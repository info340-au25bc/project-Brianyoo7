            <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
            <p>Changing careers is really hard, and one of the biggest challenges is finding good information about what
                the process actually looks like. The problem is that people who want to change careers can't easily find
                detailed and honest accounts from others who've done it. Stories that talk about what failed, what worked,
                how long things took, and what it actually felt like are often not readily accessible. Existing solutions
                fall short in different ways. LinkedIn emphasizes polished success stories but falls short in documenting
                the learning journey. Reddit's r/careerguidance has helpful advice, but it's mostly short comments scattered
                across threads. Blind has mostly become an echo chamber of career negativity and offers no real career changing
                advice. Career changers need a dedicated ,all in one platform where they can share detailed transition stories,
                discover experiences from others in similar situations, and organize helpful resources. </p>

            <!-- Who are the users? -->
            <section>
                <h3>Who are the users of this application?</h3>
                <p>
                    The main users are people thinking about changing their careers, like someone leaving marketing to learn coding,
                    a teacher wanting to get into UX design, or recent grads figuring out their field. This includes self-taught learners,
                    bootcamp students, and anyone navigating skill acquisition for a career switch. The app is inclusive because users can
                    post anonymously if they want, which is especially helpful for people from underrepresented groups who might feel more
                    comfortable sharing their struggles privately.

                <h4>Feature 1: Blog Posting (Full Feature)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Users can create new posts via a "Create Post" button in the navigation bar, which 
                        opens a form where they can write and publish their career transition stories.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each post includes fields for post title, full content with text formatting options 
                        (bold, italics, headings, bullet points, and links), career field category 
                        (like "Tech," "Healthcare," "Creative"), transition type (like "Career Switch," 
                        "Skill Building," "First Job"), and an optional cover image.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Users can edit or delete their own posts at any time by clicking the edit and delete
                        buttons on the postcard, with all changes saved to Firebase and reflected immediately
                        on the main feed page.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        The main feed page includes filter controls at the top that let users narrow down 
                        posts by career field and transition type. Users can apply multiple filters 
                        simultaneously to find the most relevant content.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each post card on the feed displays a "Save" button that allows users to add the 
                        post to one or more personal collections. When clicked, a modal appears where users 
                        can select existing collections or create a new one with a custom name 
                        (like "Frontend Development Resources" or "Interview Prep").
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Users can save the same post to multiple collections, move posts between different 
                        collections when reorganizing their resources, and manually drag-and-drop posts 
                        within a collection to prioritize the most important content.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A dedicated Collections page (accessible from the navigation bar) displays all 
                        collections as visual folder cards. Clicking into any folder shows all saved posts 
                        inside that collection in a list view.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Users can rename collections, remove individual posts from a collection, or delete 
                        entire collections as their needs evolve.

                    <li>
                        Users can like posts using a heart icon button displayed on the post cards. Likes are saved to Firebase and update in real-time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each post displays the total like count (but not individual user names who liked it) 
                        next to the heart icon. Clicking any post opens the full content on its own dedicated 
                        page where users can read everything and toggle their like status.

                        A dedicated "Liked Posts" page (accessible from the navigation bar) shows all posts 
                        a user has liked, making it easy to revisit helpful content later.

                    The main feed shows post cards with title, author (or "Anonymous"), career field, transition type, publication date,
                    content preview, and like count. Clicking any post shows the full blog with all details, author info, timestamp, and
                    options to like or save to collections. The Collections page displays collections as folders, and clicking one shows
                    all saved posts inside. The liked posts page will display all posts a user has liked. All content is user-generated and
                    there will be no external data or API is needed.

            <section>
                <h3>How does this application solve the problem?</h3>
                <p>
                    This app fixes the information problem career changers face by providing one dedicated space for detailed and personal
                    transition stories. The filtering and search make it easy to find relevant posts. The collections system solves the
                    organization challenge: users can save useful posts over the months or years their transition takes, organizing them by
                    topic (technical skills, interview tips, emotional support). The like feature helps good content surface so newcomers
                    quickly find the best advice. Unlike scattered Reddit threads or polished LinkedIn posts, this platform offers honest
                    storytelling in a discoverable, organized format where users can learn from others' complete journeys and eventually
                    contribute their own story to help the next person.
