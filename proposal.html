            The main feed shows post cards with title, author (or "Anonymous"), career field, transition type, publication date, content preview, and like count. Clicking any post shows the full blog with all details, author info, timestamp, and options to like or save to collections. The Collections page displays collections as folders, and clicking one shows all saved posts inside. The liked posts page will display all posts a user has liked. All content is user-generated and there will be no external data or API is needed.

            This app fixes the information problem career changers face by providing one dedicated space for detailed and personal transition stories. The filtering and search make it easy to find relevant posts. The collections system solves the organization challenge: users can save useful posts over the months or years their transition takes, organizing them by topic (technical skills, interview tips, emotional support). The like feature helps good content surface so newcomers quickly find the best advice. Unlike scattered Reddit threads or polished LinkedIn posts, this platform offers honest storytelling in a discoverable, organized format where users can learn from others' complete journeys and eventually contribute their own story to help the next person.
